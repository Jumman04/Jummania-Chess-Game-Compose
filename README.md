## üß© How to Use

Using the game is simple ‚Äî just call the `ChessBoardCanvas` composable in your screen layout:

```kotlin
ChessBoardCanvas(
    chessController = chessController,  // Optional: your custom controller to manage the game state
    squareColors = SquareColors(),     // Optional: customize square colors
    symbolStyle = SymbolStyle(),       // Optional: customize piece symbols
    stroke = Stroke()                  // Optional: customize stroke effects
)
```

**Example**:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ChessGameScreen() {
    ChessBoardCanvas()  // Uses default settings for a simple game
}
```

The game board is now interactive, and you can customize the colors, pieces, and strokes as needed.
